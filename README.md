# BioRela
Comparing relationships of several species with biological classification system
## The Goal of This Project
This project is a fusion of biology and programming. In this project, I will make a C program that determines several species biological relationships

### Inspirations
I was solving a programming problem at an online judge site. The problem was about LCA. Then I thougt utilizing the principles of LCA in biological classification
would be awesome. This made me start this.

### Biological backgrounds
* What does "relationships" means?
> A creature of similar ancestry and used in classifying. It is said that if a similar species of reproductive relationship occurs, the relationship is close, and if not, the relationship is far away. From an evolutionary point of view, the first cells are all said to be in a relationship of flexibility.  
* Examples  
<pre>
<code>
Input: Cosmos_bipinnatus Argophyllum
Output: Those are branched from Asterales.

### Programming Plan
1. Making biological classification diagram  
2. Transferring diagram into a tree data structure  
3. Building a C program that interprets the tree and searching relationships of several elements in the tree  

### Expansion Plan
